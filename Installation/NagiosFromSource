This guide is based on SELinux being disabled or in permissive mode. SELinux is not enabled by default on Ubuntu. If you would like to see if it is installed run the following command:

>sudo dpkg -l selinux*

 
Prerequisites

Perform these steps to install the pre-requisite packages.

===== Ubuntu 13.x / 14.x / 15.x =====

>sudo apt-get update
>sudo apt-get install -y autoconf gcc libc6 make wget unzip apache2 apache2-utils php5 libgd2-xpm-dev

 

===== Ubuntu 16.x / 17.x =====

>sudo apt-get update
>sudo apt-get install -y autoconf gcc libc6 make wget unzip apache2 php libapache2-mod-php7.0   libgd2-xpm-dev

 

Downloading the Source

>cd /tmp
>wget -O nagioscore.tar.gz https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/archive/>nagios-4.3.2.tar.gz
>tar xzf nagioscore.tar.gz

 

Compile

>cd /tmp/nagioscore-nagios-4.3.2/
>sudo ./configure --with-httpd-conf=/etc/apache2/sites-enabled
>sudo make all

 

Create User And Group

This creates the nagios user and group. The www-data user is also added to the nagios group.

>sudo useradd nagios
>sudo usermod -a -G nagios www-data

 
Install Binaries

This step installs the binary files, CGIs, and HTML files.

>sudo make install

 
Install Service / Daemon

This installs the service or daemon files and also configures them to start on boot.

>sudo make install-init
>sudo update-rc.d nagios defaults

 

Information on starting and stopping services will be explained further on.

 
Install Command Mode

This installs and configures the external command file.

>sudo make install-commandmode

 
Install Configuration Files

This installs the *SAMPLE* configuration files. These are required as Nagios needs some configuration files to allow it to start.

>sudo make install-config

 
Install Apache Config Files 

This installs the Apache web server configuration files and configures Apache settings.

>sudo make install-webconf
>sudo a2enmod rewrite
>sudo a2enmod cgi

 
Configure Firewall

You need to allow port 80 inbound traffic on the local firewall so you can reach the Nagios Core web interface.

>sudo ufw allow Apache
>sudo ufw reload

 
Create nagiosadmin User Account 

You'll need to create an Apache user account to be able to log into Nagios.

The following command will create a user account called nagiosadmin and you will be prompted to provide a password for the account.

>sudo htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin






Start Apache Web Server

===== Ubuntu 13.x / 14.x =====

Need to restart it because it is already running.

>sudo service apache2 restart

 

===== Ubuntu 15.x / 16.x / 17.x =====

Need to restart it because it is already running.

>sudo systemctl restart apache2.service

 
Start Service / Daemon

This command starts Nagios Core.

===== Ubuntu 13.x / 14.x =====

>sudo service nagios start

 

===== Ubuntu 15.x / 16.x / 17.x =====

>sudo systemctl start nagios.service

 
Test Nagios

Nagios is now running, to confirm this you need to log into the Nagios Web Interface.

Point your web browser to the ip address or FQDN of your Nagios Core server, for example:

http://10.25.5.143/nagios

http://core-013.domain.local/nagios

You will be prompted for a username and password. The username is nagiosadmin (you created it in a previous step) and the password is what you provided earlier.

Once you have logged in you are presented with the Nagios interface. Congratulations you have installed Nagios Core.








Installing The Nagios Plugins

Nagios Core needs plugins to operate properly. The following steps will walk you through installing Nagios Plugins.




Prerequisites

Make sure that you have the following packages installed.

>sudo apt-get install -y autoconf gcc libc6 libmcrypt-dev make libssl-dev wget bc gawk dc build-essential snmp libnet-snmp-perl gettext

 
Downloading The Source

>cd /tmp
>wget --no-check-certificate -O nagios-plugins.tar.gz https://github.com/nagios-plugins/nagios-plugins/archive/release-2.2.1.tar.gz
>tar zxf nagios-plugins.tar.gz

 
Compile + Install

>cd /tmp/nagios-plugins-release-2.2.1/
>sudo ./tools/setup
>sudo ./configure
>sudo make
>sudo make install

 
Test Plugins

Point your web browser to the ip address or FQDN of your Nagios Core server, for example:

http://10.25.5.143/nagios

http://core-013.domain.local/nagios

Go to a host or service object and "Re-schedule the next check" under the Commands menu. The error you previously saw should now disappear and the correct output will be shown on the screen.

 
Service / Daemon Commands

Different Linux distributions have different methods of starting / stopping / restarting / status Nagios.

===== Ubuntu 13.x / 14.x =====

>sudo service nagios start
>sudo service nagios stop
>sudo service nagios restart
>sudo service nagios status

 

===== Ubuntu 15.x / 16.x / 17.x =====

>sudo systemctl start nagios.service
>sudo systemctl stop nagios.service
>sudo systemctl restart nagios.service
>sudo systemctl status nagios.service
